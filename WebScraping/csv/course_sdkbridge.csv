Online Course,"This is the first in a series of courses for technical writers who want to learn how to write API documentation. This course teaches how to document structured data, focusing on the two most popular structured data formats: JSON and XML. If you are new to API documentation, this is a great place to start. No programming experience is required, but technical writers with programming experience who want to know more about structured data will still find it useful.",[],-1,-1,SDK Bridge,Intermediate,Learn API Technical Writing: JSON and XML for Writers,Digital Literacy,https://www.udemy.com/api-documentation-1-json-and-xml/?couponCode=sdkbridge19
Online Course,"This is the second in a series of courses for technical writers who want to learn how to write API documentation. The first course is called ""Learn API Technical Writing: JSON and XML for Writers"", and it is recommended that you first take that course, unless you are very familiar with JSON and XML, and how to document them.
This course teaches how to document REST APIs. No programming experience is required, but technical writers with programming experience who want to know more about REST APIs will still find it useful.",[],-1,-1,SDK Bridge,Intermediate,Learn API Technical Writing 2: REST for Writers,Digital Literacy,https://www.udemy.com/learn-api-technical-writing-2-rest-for-writers/?couponCode=sdkbridge24
Online Course,"This is the third in a series of courses for technical writers who want to learn how to write API documentation. The first two courses are called ""Learn API Technical Writing: JSON and XML for Writers"" and ""Learn API Technical Writing: REST for Writers"", and it's recommended that you first take those courses, unless you are very familiar with API documentation, and how to document reference material.
This course teaches how to write conceptual API documentation, such as overviews, getting started sections, and tutorials. For the most part, no programming experience is required, but technical writers with programming experience will still find it useful.
In addition to conceptual material, this course covers guidelines for good sample code, tools for making REST requests, and how to find an open source project to document as a way to get into the field of API writing.",[],-1,-1,SDK Bridge,Intermediate,The Art of API Documentation,Digital Literacy,https://www.udemy.com/the-art-of-api-documentation/?couponCode=sdkbridge14
Online Course,"The Open API Specification (often called ""Swagger"") is currently the most popular way to create definitions of RESTful APIs. With these definitions, you can create sophisticated, autogenerated documentation, generate SDKs in several languages, and do automated testing. Swagger is a set of open source tools that use these Open API Specification definition files.
This class is for people in the software industry who are fairly technical, but are not software developers: for example, project managers, API product managers, and technical writers. It assumes that you understand REST and JSON, but that's about all. It is meant to be for people who are new to the Open API Specification and Swagger, rather than for experts. It covers:",[],-1,-1,SDK Bridge,Advanced,Learn Swagger and the Open API Specification,Digital Literacy,https://www.udemy.com/learn-swagger-and-the-open-api-specification/?couponCode=SDKBRIDGE
Online Course,"There aren't many people who can both code and write well, so if you can do both, you will find there many exciting, highly-paid opportunities in the technology industry. This course teaches basic programming to writers so that you can begin to document code. 
The course uses JavaScript, but talks about other programming languages as well, including providing a survey of common programming languages. It covers common Computer Science concepts, such as variables, functions, conditionals, loops, etc. 
You'll have hands-on exercises in both writing JavaScript code and documenting constants, functions, and enumerations. You'll end with a final project where you build a therapist bot. (It's not as hard as it sounds, although it's really not a very good therapist.)",[],-1,-1,SDK Bridge,Intermediate,API Documentation: Basic Programming,Digital Literacy,https://www.udemy.com/coding-for-writers-1-basic-programming/?couponCode=SDKBRIDGE39

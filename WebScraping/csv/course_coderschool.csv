Summer Camp,"This fun camp is all about coding games - and the awesomeness that comes from it!  From Frogger to Tron or even classics like Breakout or Flappy Bird, our Code Coaches will help choose the right game(s) for our campers.  Campers will not only create a real functioning game from scratch, they'll practice the fundamental coding concepts required in any language, learn how to think logically, and have fun while doing it.  Using Scratch, MIT's popular drag-and-drop programming language, campers will code cool playable games with guidance from our seasoned Code Coaches, and have a sweet Friday afternoon demo for parents to see!  Because we do all our coding online, campers can log into their account at any time during or after camp to show off what they've done, and even keep adding to their game! ",['1101 106th Ave NE #15'],9,7,The Coder School,Beg/Int,Games Are Awesome,Game Development,https://www.thecoderschool.com/camps#games-are-awesome
Summer Camp,"Our WebRox camp is all about websites, because the web rocks!  Our campers will spend the week designing and building their very own websites and get 'em published to the world by the end of the week.  Importantly, kids will be introduced to Internet Safety and why cyber-safety matters, plus we'll learn the basics of how the internet works (wait, you mean that Facebook page lives out in the ""cloud"" somewhere?!).  As usual, our Fridays are all about the demo, showing off the all cool website stuff the kids create! ",['1101 106th Ave NE #15'],-1, 10,The Coder School,Beg/Int,WebRox,Website Coding,https://www.thecoderschool.com/camps#webrox

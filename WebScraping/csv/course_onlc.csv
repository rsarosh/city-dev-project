With the proper permissions, analysts can use SQL to select the data they need for additional analysis and reporting.  This class, SQL Querying: Fundamentals, provides an overview of the SQL commands that can be used to access that data.","['1700 7th Ave #2100', '14205 SE 36th St #100', '19125 North Creek Pkwy #120']",-1,-1,ONLC,Intermediate / Advanced,SQL Querying: Fundamentals Course Outline | ONLC,Network / Cloud,https://www.onlc.com/outline.asp?loc=WASE&ccode=XSQL01

Testing is our main means of reducing software risk and typically takes half of software projects, yet still fails to catch many important defects.  Traditional testing books and training emphasize using well-known test design techniques, including boundary tests and decision trees/tables, which indeed can help detect more defects; but their value is limited by testing too late and largely reacting to whats specified in the system design.  This interactive course shows how to use these techniques, along with additional little-known but more powerful Proactive Testing low-busywork methods that spot and can prevent many of the highest yet ordinarily-overlooked showstopper and other risks earlier when they are easier and cheaper to fix. Youll be able to deliver better software in less time by more effectively making sure the most important unit/component, integration/assembly, system, and UAT testing is done in limited available time, while also providing the value that overcomes traditional user, manager, and developer resistance.  To enhance learning, participants practice each key technique in a series of exercises with various aspects of a real case fact situation.","['1700 7th Ave #2100', '14205 SE 36th St #100', '19125 North Creek Pkwy #120']",-1,-1,ONLC,Intermediate / Advanced,Effective Methods of Software Testing Workshop Course Outline | ONLC,Network / Cloud,https://www.onlc.com/outline.asp?loc=WASE&ccode=XBAMST

This interactive course shows how to use these techniques, along with additional little-known but more powerful Proactive Testing low-busywork methods that spot and can prevent many of the highest yet ordinarily-overlooked showstopper and other risks earlier when they are easier and cheaper to fix. Youll be able to deliver better software in less time by more effectively making sure the most important unit/component, integration/assembly, system, and UAT testing is done in limited available time, while also providing the value that overcomes traditional user, manager, and developer resistance.  To enhance learning, participants practice each key technique in a series of exercises with various aspects of a real case fact situation.","['1700 7th Ave #2100', '14205 SE 36th St #100', '19125 North Creek Pkwy #120']",-1,-1,ONLC,Intermediate / Advanced,Effective Methods of Software Testing Workshop Course Outline | ONLC,Network / Cloud,https://www.onlc.com/outline.asp?loc=WASE&ccode=XBAMST

The overall objective of this class is threefold. First, this course instructs one in many of the day-to-day administration tasks required of an Oracle database administrator. Second, it is one of the course modules that assist in preparation for certification as an Oracle Certified Associated (OCA) database administrator. Finally, it introduces many of the administration sub-specialties that one might next pursue. It is increasingly rare for a single database administrator to fulfill all the required responsibilities necessary for management of an enterprise-scale Oracle database installation. Therefore, one may eventually specialize into backup and recovery strategies, database performance tuning, security administration and the like.","['1700 7th Ave #2100', '14205 SE 36th St #100', '19125 North Creek Pkwy #120']",-1,-1,ONLC,Intermediate / Advanced,Oracle Database 12c: Administration Workshop Course Outline | ONLC,Software,https://www.onlc.com/outline.asp?loc=WASE&ccode=OAD12C

This class begins with a discussion of the broad systems infrastructure where one finds Oracle database installations, and we outline how the database fits with other systems in a multi-tiered architecture, including web servers, application servers and engineered systems such as the Oracle Exadata database computing platform. We then explore the intricacies of a single database installation, including memory, process and storage structures. Periodically we delve into the internals of the database, probing into such areas internal locking mechanisms, kernel module calls and database failures.","['1700 7th Ave #2100', '14205 SE 36th St #100', '19125 North Creek Pkwy #120']",-1,-1,ONLC,Intermediate / Advanced,Oracle Database 12c: Architecture and Internals Course Outline | ONLC,Software,https://www.onlc.com/outline.asp?loc=WASE&ccode=OAI12C

This course offers a step-by-step guide for the installation of the optional Oracle 12c grid infrastructure followed by the installation of an Oracle 12c database. The primary focus is the configuration of a Linux host system, with helpful hints for other supported platforms such as Oracle Linux, Unix and MS Windows. This textbook starts with a bare-metal server system and guides one through the process of an operating system installation, operating system configuration and finally the Oracle grid infrastructure and Oracle database installations.","['1700 7th Ave #2100', '14205 SE 36th St #100', '19125 North Creek Pkwy #120']",-1,-1,ONLC,Intermediate / Advanced,Oracle Database 12c: Install and Upgrade Workshop Course Outline | ONLC,Software,https://www.onlc.com/outline.asp?loc=WASE&ccode=OIU12C

The single most important new capability introduced with the Oracle 12c release of the database is the multitenant database feature. With this technology, the Oracle database can be a full participant in a cloud computing-based application architecture. Even a traditional on-premise systems architecture can be dynamically and dramatically transformed as a result of this feature. Many traditional and new database features are enhanced or introduced when a multitenant database configuration is used.","['1700 7th Ave #2100', '14205 SE 36th St #100', '19125 North Creek Pkwy #120']",-1,-1,ONLC,Intermediate / Advanced,Oracle Database 12c: New Features Part 1: Manage the Multitenant Architecture Course Outline | ONLC,Software,https://www.onlc.com/outline.asp?loc=WASE&ccode=ONF12C

Course Objectives
The overall objective of this course is to bring database administrators beyond a basic understanding of their environment and to focus attention on more advanced skills needed to effectively configure, administer, monitor and tune the database within a large-scale enterprise. Specific subjects to be considered are:
  Automatic database management, monitoring and tuning facilities. Included is automatic management of storage space and memory resources within the database.
  Using Oracle flashback technology to recover from user errors and from database failures, including flashback data archive and flashback transaction backout along with the Total Recall capability.
  Controlling resource utilization on database servers whose resource demand exceeds its capacity.
  Automating launching routine maintenance tasks and even application functions using the database Scheduler.
  Handling database corruption.
  Utilizing diagnostic sources in troubleshooting database problems and employing the Fault Diagnosability Infrastructure to capture fault data.
  Automatic resumption of database operations even in the face of failures and errors.
  User-managed and automatically managed backup strategies and database recovery operations.
  Use advanced Enterprise Manager wizards and tools, including the integrated LogMiner, Flasback Transaction Backout wizard, database Recovery Wizard, and others.
  Automatic Storage Management (ASM) of some or all database files, providing a database-centric and optimized storage subsystem and volume manager.

Target Audience
The primary target audience for this course is Oracle database administrators. Oracle web server and application server administrators, as well as others who must manage an embedded repository database using Oracle database technology will also find this information useful.
 
This course is also recommended for technical consultants, support engineers, project managers and other technical management and support personnel.

The overall objective of this class is threefold. First, this course instructs one in many of the day-to-day administration tasks required of an Oracle database administrator. Second, it is one of the course modules that assist in preparation for certification as an Oracle Certified Associated (OCA) database administrator. Finally, it introduces many of the administration sub-specialties that one might next pursue. It is increasingly rare for a single database administrator to fulfill all the required responsibilities necessary for management of an enterprise-scale Oracle database installation. Therefore, one may eventually specialize into backup and recovery strategies, database performance tuning, security administration and the like.","['1700 7th Ave #2100', '14205 SE 36th St #100', '19125 North Creek Pkwy #120']",-1,-1,ONLC,Intermediate / Advanced,Oracle Database 12c: Administration Workshop Course Outline | ONLC,Software,https://www.onlc.com/outline.asp?loc=WASE&ccode=OAD12C
Class / Web Course,"
This class begins with a discussion of the broad systems infrastructure where one finds Oracle database installations, and we outline how the database fits with other systems in a multi-tiered architecture, including web servers, application servers and engineered systems such as the Oracle Exadata database computing platform. We then explore the intricacies of a single database installation, including memory, process and storage structures. Periodically we delve into the internals of the database, probing into such areas internal locking mechanisms, kernel module calls and database failures.","['1700 7th Ave #2100', '14205 SE 36th St #100', '19125 North Creek Pkwy #120']",-1,-1,ONLC,Intermediate / Advanced,Oracle Database 12c: Architecture and Internals Course Outline | ONLC,Software,https://www.onlc.com/outline.asp?loc=WASE&ccode=OAI12C

This course offers a step-by-step guide for the installation of the optional Oracle 12c grid infrastructure followed by the installation of an Oracle 12c database. The primary focus is the configuration of a Linux host system, with helpful hints for other supported platforms such as Oracle Linux, Unix and MS Windows. This textbook starts with a bare-metal server system and guides one through the process of an operating system installation, operating system configuration and finally the Oracle grid infrastructure and Oracle database installations.","['1700 7th Ave #2100', '14205 SE 36th St #100', '19125 North Creek Pkwy #120']",-1,-1,ONLC,Intermediate / Advanced,Oracle Database 12c: Install and Upgrade Workshop Course Outline | ONLC,Software,https://www.onlc.com/outline.asp?loc=WASE&ccode=OIU12C
Class / Web Course,"
The single most important new capability introduced with the Oracle 12c release of the database is the multitenant database feature. With this technology, the Oracle database can be a full participant in a cloud computing-based application architecture. Even a traditional on-premise systems architecture can be dynamically and dramatically transformed as a result of this feature. Many traditional and new database features are enhanced or introduced when a multitenant database configuration is used.","['1700 7th Ave #2100', '14205 SE 36th St #100', '19125 North Creek Pkwy #120']",-1,-1,ONLC,Intermediate / Advanced,Oracle Database 12c: New Features Part 1: Manage the Multitenant Architecture Course Outline | ONLC,Software,https://www.onlc.com/outline.asp?loc=WASE&ccode=ONF12C
